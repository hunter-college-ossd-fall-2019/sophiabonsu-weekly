# Wikipedia 

Investigating Wikipedia from a contributors perspective was interesting.I  learned the various criteria by which, certain information is classified . I discovered the difference between the article page and the talk page. The article page contain information such as early life, career, personal life,discography,award and nominations. Then there talk page which acts a discussion forum as to how to improve the article page. The talk page is  objective in the making sure only discuss improvements and not the article in general.Its also has be polite and welcome new users section thats great for navigation.The have an adventure section of the project page that teaches  you step by step how to edit.
