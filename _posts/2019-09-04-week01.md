I decided to enroll in this class because of the community aspect that Open source software development fosters. I recently finished a summer bootcamp and I was excited to build on the tools and lessons I gained during my time there.I am fairly  new to open source software development. 

**Some of the open source software that I have used include:**

*Ubuntu
*WordPress
*Python

 This course will allow us to learn to communicate and contribute our perspective to the world. My hope is that with the activities and lessons we learn the world can become less intimidating with regard to information whether its how to obtain said information or how to use said information. My goal is to efficiently contribute to open source projects on a global level.
