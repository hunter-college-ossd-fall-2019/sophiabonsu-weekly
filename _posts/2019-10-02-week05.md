title: Week 5
---

We continued to build on our git knowledge this week by implementing a contribution workflow. The simulation was very helpful in understanding the process of  how to contribute to a project from the beginning to the coflicts we would encounter to the very end. We also read an article about finding a project to contribute to, very resourceful. 



# [Finding a project to contribute to ](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to)
### The article on finding a project to which you can contribute has a great amount of information and advice. It also has links to other webpages that help you in finding projects. Explore these links and comment on which might prove to be useful, and whether they have helped you to narrow down your search.



# GitHub stuff
Initially I found the workflow  intimidating  and overwhelming to implement. Once I took some deep breaths I was able to focus on the task at hand.I committed myself to learning through the numerous mistakes I would without a doubt make. We were unable to  complete the task during class so we finished on our later. We first needed to establish how to communicate outside of class and learned that you can tag the username of the person you'd like to contact whether in your issues or in your comments. I made my fist mistake  when I cloned the repository into a parent folder instead of my team folder, so it only showed the upstream version without the origin. I learned how to update the url of the existing remote repository. The workflow portion was overwhelming but incredibly useful. I opened an issue and created a feature branch to work on the issue -adding dancestyles to favorite songs.

Overall I'm appreciative of the  kstakes i make because it allows me to ask for help and learn little tricks that expands my git and Github knowledge.
