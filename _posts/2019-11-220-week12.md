# Project Update

I was insired by the humanitarian FOSS projesct that we covered in class this past week and so the journey down the rabbit hole began. I started exploring the Social Impact page of github. I found a lot of great projects that seemed  abandoned. Some of the most recent of the pull request had been there for a year or so without being merged. I kept sifting through projects and found one called Refuge Restrooms that provide safe restroom access for transgender, intersex, and gender nonconforming individuals. I looked throught the issues and there's was one that seemed manageable. The challenge is that the application is coded in ruby but the issue involves adding images so that an upside. I then commented on the [issue](https://github.com/RefugeRestrooms/refugerestrooms/issues/563) to both contact the maintainer and to gauge  the staleness. I [forked](https://github.com/sophiabonsu/refugerestrooms) the repo and cloned it onto my local machine. I want to use sites like [wiki commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), [unsplash] (https://unsplash.com/) and other free image sites for the addtion to the project.The project had instructions on downloading the environment. As it stands I have to learn how to add images on a ruby application. I am excited to work in ths project the impact seems very real and tangible.
